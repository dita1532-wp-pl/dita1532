  <h2>Attack</h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be spearers or smashers. </p>
  <br>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey and can cause serious damage to victims larger than themselves. </br>
  <h2>Eyesight</h2>
   <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
   <br>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum. </br>
